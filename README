AXIOMATIC
=========

A companion GUI for AXIOME (Automation, Extension, and Integration of Microbial Ecology).
This interace guides the user through the creation of a .ax file, which can be sent to a server
running AXIOME, and used to initiate an analysis.

This package requires Python 2.7, python-gi, and pygtk.

To install from source, run:
sudo python setup.py install

Then, run the command `axiomeatic` and follow the wizard to create a .ax file for your AXIOME
analysis.
