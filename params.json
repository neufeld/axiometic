{"tagline":"A GUI companion for AXIOME","body":"Axiometic is a simple GUI for creating .ax files for use with [AXIOME](http://neufeld.github.com/AXIOME/). It guides the user through the creation of the configuration file, which can then be used to start an AXIOME analysis.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\nComing soon\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nInstallation is possible on Windows, Linux and Mac. Pre-built packages for all three platforms are coming soon.\r\n\r\n### Ubuntu Precise 12.04 (or other Linux distros)\r\nThe source can be downloaded in [tarball format](http://github.com/neufeld/axiometic/tarball/master). As long as you have Python 2.6+, the GTK toolkit, and the PyGTK bindings installed (all included with Ubuntu), you can run the app by running the following commands:\r\n\r\n     tar xvzf neufeld-axiometic-*.tar.gz\r\n     cd neufeld-axiometic-*\r\n     cd python-axiometic\r\n     sudo python setup.py install\r\n\r\nIt can then be run with the command `axiometic`.\r\n\r\n### Windows\r\n\r\nYou must install [Python](http://www.python.org/download/) and the [PyGTK all-in-one package](http://www.pygtk.org/downloads.html). The source code can be downloaded as a [zip file](http://github.com/neufeld/axiometic/zipball/master). Once extracted, you can simply double-click the python_axiometic/axiomeui.py file to run the application.\r\n\r\n## Authors/Contact Information\r\n\r\nMichael Hall <[hallm2533@gmail.com](mailto:hallm2533@gmail.com)>","note":"Don't delete this file!
